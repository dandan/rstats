h1. RStats

This script was created by Daniel Laeng to demonstrate what kind of statistics we could use to measure amee's data quality.

h2. Status

Currently this is just an experiment, the code is horrible and untested.

h3. Setup

bc. sudo apt-get install r-base
git clone git@github.com:dandan/rstats.git
cd rstats/src
sudo ./install-dependencies.r

h3. Run

bc. ssh ubuntu@data-wranger.amee.com

Assuming the megafile is in /mnt/data/export/megafile.csv

bc. ./rstats.r --input /mnt/data/export/megafile.csv --config ../config/megafile_v1.r

The resulting charts are stored as PNGs in the output/ folder, in a subfolder named after the input filename. They can be seen at http://data-wrangler.amee.com


h3. Introduction to R

Open docs/introduction.r within RStudio.
